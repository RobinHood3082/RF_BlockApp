Blockchain Application (E-voting) on ndnSIM/ns3 using NDN/UDP using RocketFuel topology

Named-Data Network (NDN), also known as "the future internet architecture" is a content-centric network architecture for the next generation of decentralized internet. It is an excellent choice for Blockchain applications due to its in-network caching feature.

RocketFuel Topologies are a set of topologies used in real-world internet backbones over continents.

This research project is a simulation and comparison of various Blockchain applications over NDN and traditional IP-based protocols.

Blockchain-based NDN Applications over RocketFuel Topology using ns3/ndnSIM

Named-Data Network (NDN), also known as "the future internet architecture" is a content-centric network architecture for the next generation of decentralized internet. It is an excellent choice for Blockchain applications due to its in-network caching feature.

RocketFuel Topologies are a set of topologies used in real-world internet backbones over continents.

This research project is a simulation and comparison of various Blockchain applications over NDN and traditional IP-based protocols.

# Usage

## Installation
- Install ndnSIM: https://ndnsim.net/current/
- Clone this repo into ns3/scratch directory

## Compilation
```
cd ns3/
./waf
```

``` ./waf ``` command builds everything in scratch any time a change occurs.
